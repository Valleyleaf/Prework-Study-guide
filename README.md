# Prework-Study-guide

## Description:
A study guide for course pre-work, created by following the steps provided to me by edX.

## A. MOTIVATION
This project was created to familiarize myself with HTML, CSS and JavaSCript, along with learning about how to use Git Bash and GitHub in a professional setting. My previous experience was limited to Python so this project has been very interesting.


## B. PURPOSE
This project was made to not only learn, but to also create a online repository where I can keep notes around these topics that I have learned about in this course. Additionally, this website will serve as a good lab environment for me to continue to experiment with different types of code and styles. Since I have 2 computers, a desktop and laptop, I am able to imagine myself as two people working and updating this project, which is good repetition for me as I am new to Git Bash.


## C. CONCLUTION
I have prior experience with coding, both in HTML and JavaScript. I also have a 15 year old project that I have built. It's not raw code, but the structure and mindset is the same, so it lends itself to my way of coding and preparing projects. New to me was CSS and Git Bash, neither of which I have ever used before. CSS is interesting to me as I am very interested in design, being an artist in my free time. Git Bash, while still somewhat foreign to me has enticed me to learn more as I believe it has capabilities far beyond what has been taught to me so far.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
